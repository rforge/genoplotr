<h3>Main functions:</h3>
<p>Be sure to check plot_gene_map and the reading functions first</p>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linear representation of several segments of DNA</li>
  <li>Comparisons represented by areas between the segments (like Artemis, 
    for example)</li>
  <li>Reads from common formats: Genbank, EMBL, blast, Mauve, and from 
    user-generated tab files</li>
  <li>Plot several subsegments of the same segment on the same line, separated
    by a //</li>
  <li>Automatic or manual placement of the segments on the plot</li>
  <li>Add annotations to all the lines</li>
  <li>Add a user-generated tree</li>
  <li>Add a global scale or a scale to each line</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, since the package is developed with grid, it is easy (i) to 
  reproduce exactly the same figure and (ii) to integrate it into larger 
  figures</p>
