TODO:
- change coloring when reading from mauve bbones: color first segments in the ref genome, and then according to their apparition in the next genomes.
- read xmfa format from mauve, mugsy. See description on the mauve website. Take quality into account
- filter given several ranges/features on any segment, by successive filtering of the nearby segments, keeping only ranges that have comparisons better than x and with margins of y. Return xlim?
- Check filtering of comparisons: how do I treat partial matches? Seems inconsistent...
- Read from gff3 files
- Read color tags from genbank/embl/gff(?) file
